These are my unpublished notes on physics, metaphysics or philosophy. They were written at different times, and honestly, some thoughts are neither rigorous nor mature, and I, currently, cannot even agree with all of them. However, these thoughts may contain 'some elements' of truth, so I believe they are still worth reading.
