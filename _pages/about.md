Research Area
------
* **Quantum Computation**.  **Quantum Physics**. 

------
Include: computing models, simulation, algorithm, implementation, control, topological qubits, quantum channel, open-system, heat engine, thermodynamics, non-Markovian dynamics, many-body system, entanglement, quantum notions

Highlights
------
* QC by symmetry: information processing induced by measurement, see PRL 

* A topological gate by 'twist': twist symmetry-protected top order slowly to obtain a quantum gate, see PRL

* Hyper-teleportation: teleportation and QC with hypergraph states, see IJMP 

* Qubit channel universal simulator: only need a CNOT gate and a pbit to get arbitrary qubit noise, see PRL
